HSV stands for hue-saturation-value.\n\nHue is a degree from 0 to 360 representing a color wheel: red at 0&deg;, green at 120&deg;, blue at 240&deg;, and red again at 360&deg;. This makes it easy to cycle through colors and compute color complements, triads, tetrads, etc.\n\nSaturation is a number between 1 and 0 where lowering this number makes your color more grey. This can help you tone a color down.\n\nValue is also a number between 1 and 0. Lowering this number makes your color more black.\n\nLook up the &ldquo;HSV cylinder&rdquo; for more information.")
